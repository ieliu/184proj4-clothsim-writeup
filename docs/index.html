<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<h3> Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project. </h3>
<p> In this project, we were able to explore and create a simulation of cloth in multiple settings (such as falling, being pinned, or hanging from a sphere). We began with building a system made up of point masses and springs to divide the cloth up into even-sized pieces. Next, we used numerical integration to model how our cloth would move at any point in time; one thing we had to consider were forces applied to our cloth like gravity and the spring states of each point. Then, we had to handle collisions of our cloth with other things like spheres and planes; we did so by correcting any collisions between the two objects and making it so that our cloth would float above other objects rather than just going through the–this brought back old concepts like ray intersections! We continued with collisions by handling the cloth colliding into itself, but instead of correcting collisions with other objects, we corrected with the point masses within the cloth; in order to avoid inefficiencies, we implemented spatial hashing that would allow us to “repulse” any self-collisions. Finally, we implemented shaders that allowed us to apply texture and lighting to our cloth! We linked vertex and fragment shaders which deal with the vertex geometry and rendering/coloring, respectively.  </p>

<h3>
    Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing
    <kbd>P</kbd> again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
</h3>

<small>
        Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>?
        A high <code>ks</code>?
</small>
<p> Changing the spring constant ks will essentially affect how flexible or stiff the cloth will be. At a very low ks, we see a lot of ripple within the cloth and high degree of flexibility.
    At a high ks, we see that the cloth is very stiff, with much fewer creases and flexibility </p>

<small>
    What about for <code>density</code>?
</small>

<p>The density will affect the mass per unit area of the cloth. It determines how much the cloth reacts to different forces. At a low density, the cloth would fall a bit slower and is more sensitive. At a high density, the cloth falls quicker as it is seemingly heavier. The force of gravity pulls the cloth down at a greater force.
</p>
<small>
    What about for <code>damping</code>?-->
</small>

<p> Damping tells us the amount of resistance the cloth offers for motion. Having a higher percentage of damping means that the cloth is affected by motion less, the cloth falls slower. While having a lower percentage of damping makes it fall much faster.</p>

</div>

<p>We can see as our ks value increases, our cloth seems to almost "open up". At ks = 500, the cloth seems to hang
    a little lower, and it really clings to the sphere. At ks = 50000, the cloth opens up, and it seems to
    almost parachute over the sphere. This makes sense, since a larger ks means stiffer springs, and the cloth would
    therefore look stiffer. The opposite holds as well, a smaller ks means a more flexible cloth that is able to
    closely drape itself over the sphere. </p>

<h3>Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</h3>

<p> With a lower density, our cloth folds in itself fairly easily. From the early fall, we see that the moment the cloth touches the plane,
the whole cloth begins to fold, and the simulation shows it falling almost gracefully as it floats down to its final resting point.
    With a higher density, the cloth is really resistant to folds in the early fall, as we can see the top of the cloth remains fairly flat and the folds are mild.
    At its final resting state, though, the cloth flattens and folds tightly.

<p>With greater Ks, the cloth seemingly stays extremely rigid and tries to maintain its shape as it falls since

<h3>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</h3>

<p> A shader program is essentially a program that helps create realistic lighting and materials on 3D objects. Vertex shaders process the geometry
    of the 3D objects, which includes position, rotations, scaling, and texture coordinate mapping. Fragment shaders help generate effects
    such as color and lighting at the pixel. They work together to create lighting and material effects on 3D objects in time. </p>

<h3>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component,
    a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting
    the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</h3>

<p> Blinn Phong shading works by calculating the reflection of a light source on a surface, and calculating how much of that reflection is visible to the viewer. The amount of reflection is also determined by the angle of the light coming in and the angle of the viewer to the surface. To do this we have to calculate the ambient light, the diffuse light, and the specular light. We then add these three terms together to obtain the final color and lighting of the pixel.

    Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's
    coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128. </h3>

<p>
    The differences between our bump and displacement mappings are subtle, but noticeable upon taking a closer look. Our bump mapping
    shows the texture that we're putting on, yet the cloth and sphere are still smooth. Displacement is able to simulate how the texture
    that we're place will affect the surface of our sphere and cloth. We can see that the displacement mapping looks bumpy where the cloth
    touches the sphere, while the bump mapping is smooth.

<p>
    As for how the shaders react to the sphere mesh's coarseness, it's much more noticeable with the displacement shader. The bumps created
    by the texture are smoother and more prominent with a higher coarseness, which makes sense since a higher coarseness seems to correlate with more flexibility.
    The bump shader doesn't seem to change much between different coarseness levels.
